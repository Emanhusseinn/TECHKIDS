    Elements consisting of tags enclosed in position brackets denote HTML. These elements apply as the structure blocks for every website built. HTML allows for descriptions and entrenchment of items and application when creating association forms. It also offers the means to generate ordered credentials through indicating structural semantics for text in the form of headings, paragraphs, lists and associations, among others.

 Delivery of HTML documents applies means similar to those used by other computer files. In some instances, delivery happens through hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). An HTML element refers to all items between the start and end tags. The universal form of HTML elements is in a pair of tags consisting of a start tag and an end tag.

 Interpretation of HTML by web browsers into structured data does not constitute a programming language. The key feature of a programming language is the presence of functional roles. HTML is applicable to structural roles, as it does not execute any actions. The key features of HTML that disqualify it as a programming language are lack of restricted statements, lack of input and the presence of output, and failure to define functions that can influence information.

 The inability of an individual to compute a sum in HTML disqualifies it as a programming language. Therefore, HTML is not a programming language. A programming language will allow a user to illustrate a process that generates defined outcome while HTML will only add context and structure to a text.

 HTML is clearly a markup language. Markup language denotes a formatting design that transforms original text into ordered documents. Markup exists in two distinctive categories namely: expressive or structural mark up and technical or presentational markup.

Expressive markup describes how documents structure happens while presentational markup specifies the manner in which document presentation applies.
